# emacs-grayscale-theme

This is a simple, mostly grayscale theme, created as a mashup of some ideas of
the Duotone Atom themes, the base16 emacs themes, and zenburn.

It is currently meant as an experiment and may not be supported in the future,
so use at your own risk.

## Colors

There are a few sets of colors you need to be aware of. The first is the
background sets. They are arranged below darkest to lightest.

TODO: Guidelines for using the `bg` colors.

* ![#2e2e2e](https://placehold.it/15/2e2e2e/000000?text=+) `bg   #2e2e2e`
* ![#383838](https://placehold.it/15/383838/000000?text=+) `bg+1 #383838`
* ![#424242](https://placehold.it/15/424242/000000?text=+) `bg+2 #424242`
* ![#474747](https://placehold.it/15/474747/000000?text=+) `bg+3 #474747`

The foreground colors are also arranged from darkest to lighest. They should be
used for most text. `fg` is meant to be used for general text, while `fg-1`
should be used to deemphasize text (like comments and strings) and `fg+1` should
be used to emphasize text (like variable names).

* ![#868686](https://placehold.it/15/868686/000000?text=+) `fg-1 #868686`
* ![#b6b6b6](https://placehold.it/15/b6b6b6/000000?text=+) `fg   #b6b6b6`
* ![#e6e6e6](https://placehold.it/15/e6e6e6/000000?text=+) `fg+1 #e6e6e6`

The next set of colors are used only as accent colors and should be used
sparingly.

TODO: Find a better base `blue` and maybe switch the current blue to
one of the cyan accents.
